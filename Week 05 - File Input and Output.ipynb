With different arrangemens of these 1's and 0's, it made the computer able to interpret whether it is a text file, or an image. "

Each characters are represented by a character code. `'a'` is represented by 97. To represent 97 in 1's and 0's, we must understand how to convert binary numbers to decimals. Taking 97 itself, it can be decomposed by $97\\;=\\;9\\;\\times\\;10\\;+\\;7\\;\\times\\;1$. $1$ and $10$ represents the order of decimal digits. So $1$, $2$, $4$ represents the binary digits.
